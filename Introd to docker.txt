INTRODUCTION TO DOCKER SQL IMAGE CREATION 

STEP 1
Once you have installed docker into you application you will have to pull the MSSQL linux server for docker this can be 
done using the following commmand. 
This command allows you to download the latest SQL server for linux docker image
docker pull microsoft/mssql-server-linux
This should show a bunch of numers and letters and the message pull complete.

STEP 2
Once that's complete you can run the following command to launch the instace of the docker image you just downloaded
docker run -d --name sql_server -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'SA_PASSWORD=76Ionach76' -p 1433:1433 microsoft/mssql-server-linux
Explanation of the parameters

-d: this launches the docker container in daemon mode - this means that it runs in its own background and does not 
    need it's own terminal - omitting this parameter would mean that it would run in it's own terminal

--name sql_server: The options allows you to name your container - this can be handy when stopping or starting your 
  contianer from the terminal

-e 'ACCEPT_EULR=Y': y shown you agree with the (End User licence Agreement) - this is important in order to have SQL
  Server linux running i bielive or windows.

-e 'SA_PASSWORD=76Ionach67': this is a required parameter that allows you to set the database password

-p 1433:1433 : This maps the local port 1433 to port 1433 on the container - this is the default TCP port that SQL 
   Server uses to listen to  connections.

microsoft/mssql-server-linux : this tells docker which image to use

NOTE: make sure to use a very strong password otherwise this will not work.

STEP 3
check if the docker container is working using the following command 
docker ps 

STEP 4 install sql-cli 

Run the following command to install the sql-cli command line tool - this tool allows you to run quires and other commands
against your SQL server instance. Assuming you have nodejs installed into you machine.

STEP 5 Connect the SQL Server
now that the sql-cli is installed - we can start working with SQL Server via the Terminal windows, connecting the server
is done using the mssql command followed by the username and passord parameters

mssql -u sa -p 76Ionach67
